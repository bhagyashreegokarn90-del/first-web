         <p style="font-size: xx-large">Our family is rooted to gokarna, karnataka.<br> Our ancestors came to kashi and served pilgrims and we still carry the legacy.<br>
                We are purohits(priests) , performing 'kshetravidhi'(various devine rituals like shraddha, pooja, asthi visarjan, bramhan bhojan, etc) is our main service.
             <br> Pilgrims often are adviced to perform 'teertha shraddha'(refer our services page) as a primary ritual, when you visit any 'kshetra'(place of religious importance) like <b>kashi</b>.

                <CENTER> <h2>IMPORTANCE OF TEERTHA SHRADDHA</h2> </CENTER>
                <p style="font-size: xx-large"> According ancient 'vedas and puranas', 'teertha shraddha' performed at kashi,gaya and prayagraj is reffered to as a very auspicious ritual.<br> 
                    It is also mentioned that every individual is born with three debts (ऋण).Debts from father, God and Sage(rishi).<br> 
                By performing 'teertha shraddha' at prayagraj along with 'veni-dana'(married women offering a small length of hair cutting-off from head and immerse IT in sangam. Performed for her soubhagya(long-life of her husband.)) Which is performed only in prayagraj.Helps in freeing one-self from depts from pitru(father)<br>
                Similarly, performing the same at 'gaya' and 'kashi' helps one-self free from their debts from 'deva'(God) and 'rishi'(sage).</p>

            <li class="w3-theme-13">
            <p style="font-size: xx-large"> "kashi-yatra" is a sacred duty of every sanatani.<br> Pilgrims come to kashi with lots of asthetic values to perform various customs.<br>
            Many pilgrims(especillay, karnataka people in majority) come to us to full-fill their various sacred rituals like <i>shraddha</i>,<i>poojas</i>,<i>Asthi visarjan</i>.<br> 
            We serve them with lots of DEVOTION.<br>
